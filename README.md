# PhonePe pulse data visualization and exploration- Problem Statement
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.


## Outcomes of the project ##
1. **Data extraction and processing:**
     The data has been extracted using clone Github from a repository and preprocessed using python libraries 
     such as Pandas.
2. **Database management:**
     Relational database MySQL has been used to store and retrieve data efficiently for analysis and 
     visualization.
3. **Visualization and dashboard creation:**
      To create interactive and visually appealing dashboards libraries such as Streamlit and Plotly are 
     used
4.  **Geo-visualization:**
    Data has been displayed on a map using Plotly's built-in geo map functions

## Approach ##
1. **Data extraction:**
   Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in JSON format.
  
2. **Data transformation:**
    Use a scripting language Python and libraries such as Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may
include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

3. **Database insertion:**
    Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL
commands.

4. **Dashboard creation:**
   Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map
functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to
select different facts and figures to display.

5. **Data retrieval:**
    Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
